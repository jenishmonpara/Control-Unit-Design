# Control-Unit-Design

Design of a simple control unit.

## Flow of control : 
* Fetches instructions from instruction memory
* loads data from ROM to registers
* signals ALU to generate output which is again stored into the ROM
* All within 3 system clock cycles

## Currently ALU only supports addition but other operations can easily be added
